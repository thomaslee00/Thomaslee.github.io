The Github account is named after my first and middle name and contains little information at the moment.
The repository is made and saved in 2 locations. One in my general files and one in the programming class folder.
Lastly, I downloaded the Github desktop app to my computer, created a repository and cloned my main repository to save the copy in my class folder.
